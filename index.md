## Abstracts

<a name="gemma"></a> **On Acceptable Connexive Logics with the Variable Sharing Property** \\
Gemma Robles *(Universidad de Léon)* 
<div style="text-align: justify"> It is known that addition of Aristotle’s thesis to a relevant logic does not necessarily result in an acceptable connexive logic. In fact, there are not acceptable connexive extensions of basic relevant logic B. On the other hand, it is also well known that a necessary property of any relevant logic is the variable sharing property (VSP). In this paper, a number of acceptable connexive logics with the VSP (i.e., acceptable relevant connexive logics) is presented together with a series of results about them.

<a name="nicholas"></a> **Vector Spaces as Topic Structures in Topic-Sensitive Logics** \\
Nicholas Ferenz *(Universidade de Lisboa)* 
<div style="text-align: justify"> In this talk I motivate using vector spaces in topic-sensitive logics, given several logics as semantics, and sketch routes to completeness proofs (i.e., building vector spaces from sets of formulas). The motivation for vector spaces is related to their use in representing both syntactic and semantic aspects of words for use in natural language processing. In particular, formal relations between vectors corresponds to semantic relations between topics. These vector space models further open the possibility of logics that represent disagreement between agents in terms of disagreements of topics: e.g., “do A and B really mean the same thing by this formula?” The Variable Sharing Property is then reconceptualized as a special case of topic preservation. This is spelled out using vector spaces and projections.

<a name="brandon"> **VSPursuer: A VSP Verification Tool for MaGIC** </a> \\
Brandon Rozek *(Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> For a given logic, there may be thousands of satisfiable matrix models. Finding models which satisfy variable sharing is a labor-intensive process. In this talk, we introduce VSPursuer, a software tool that automatically finds witnesses for VSP. The tool is designed on top of MaGIC, leveraging existing algorithms to generate the initial candidate set of satisfiable models. We provide an overview on how to use the new tool, the techniques used to automate the search process, and discuss avenues for future developments. This includes joint work with Andrew Tedder. </div>

\\
<a name="shay"></a> **Nonuniform Substitutions, Variable Sharing, and the Enigma of Contraction**\\
Shay Logan (*Kansas State University*)

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Relevant logics share variables. Weak relevant logics are also closed under interesting classes of nonuniform substitutions. In this talk I will show that in a range of interesting cases, the latter entails the former. This allows us give easy proofs of (new and exciting!) strong variable sharing results without relying on Belnap’s variable sharing results for the logic R. But there’s an enigma to address. R admits contraction. So variable sharing and contraction are clearly compatible. Yet (as I will show) contraction seems entirely incompatible with the whole business of nonuniform substitutions. If time permits after surveying this much, I will say a few
words about how we might overcome this obstacle.
</div>

\\
<a name="sandra"></a> **The Variable-Sharing Property and the Quasi-Relevance Property in 4-Valued Logics**\\
Sandra López *(Ruhr University Bochum)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The variable-sharing property (VSP) is considered the main condition for a formal system to be a relevance logic, that is, to be free of paradoxes of relevance i.e., conditional formulas where the antecedent and the consequent do not share any common semantic content. The VSP can be defined as follows: a logic L has the VSP iff, for all theorems in L of the form A → B, A and B share at least a propositional variable. In Robles (2023), a general method to build binary expansions of FOUR (i.e., the system also known as Belnap-Dunn logic B4, which is equivalent to FDE) with the VSP is shown; in addition, an interesting logic determined by one of these expansions is fully developed and its fundamental properties are explored. On the other hand, the quasi-relevant property (QRP) is characteristic of logics in the family of relevance such as R-Mingle and may be defined as follows: a logic L has the QRP iff, for all theorems in L of the form A → B, either (i) A and B share a propositional variable or (ii) both ¬A and B are theorems. The aim of this talk is twofold: (1) to extend the method in Robles (2023) for the purpose of building implicative expansions of FOUR with the QRP; (2) to establish different criteria to choose among these matrices in order to develop logics that may be of interest from the point of view of relevance as something else than mere artificial constructs.

<a name="damian"></a> **More Semantics for Angell’s Logic of Analytic Containment**\\
Damian Szmuc *(CONICET)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This presentation aims to explore new semantics for Angell's logic of Analytic Containment through the discussion of the topic-transformativeness of negation. For this purpose, we review some new developments by Song, Omori, Arenhart, and Tojo on two-address valuations for topic-transparent logics related to content inclusion, and extend their techniques for Angell's logic of Analytic Containment. In particular, we present a 4-valued non-deterministic and a 16-valued deterministic semantics, both obtained through direct products of De Morgan lattices and involutive semilattices. (Joint work with Martina Zirattu)

\\
<a name="martina"></a> **On Weak Kleene Generalizations of Classical Logic**\\
Martina Zirattu *(Università di Torino)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In an article that appeared some years ago, Stefan Wintein analyzed the effect that adopting different definitions of logical consequence had on three- and four-valued strong Kleene generalizations of Classical Logic. In a nutshell, these generalizations of Classical Logic consist of keeping the same truth and falsity conditions for the complex logical expressions, while allowing for truth-value gaps or gluts. Our work aims to study the effect of adopting different definitions of logical consequence on weak Kleene generalizations of Classical Logic. The characteristic feature of weak Kleene logics is their ability to handle grammatical but otherwise meaningless, nonsensical, or off-topic sentences in a formally systematic way. Thus, our generalizations keep the truth and falsity conditions of Classical Logic the same for the complex logical expressions, while allowing for truth-value gaps or gluts---and, most importantly, for meaningless, nonsensical, or off-topic sentences to be around.
</div>

\\
<a name="blane"></a> **Decorating Classical Logic**\\
Blane Worley *(UC Davis)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I investigate the closure under non-uniform substitutions of consecutions in bunched systems. In particular, I characterize the sublogic of classical logic that is maximally closed under depth substitutions. I then provide a tableau semantics for each of these systems and demonstrate their formal equivalence. Finally, I speculate whether these maximal sublogics are known logics and whether they enjoy the variable sharing property. 
</div>

\\
<a name="tore"></a> **Entailment or Implication**\\
Tore Øgaard *(University of Bergen)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Relevant logics can be motivated in roughly two ways; (A) as a theory about a conditional---"relevant implication"---or (B) as a theory of logical consequence. 
The first first will typically appeal to natural language conditionals in order to substantiate the claim that certain conditionals fail to be true if the antecedent and consequent are about distinct topics. The other theory will typically claim that there is a notion of logical consequence---"entailment"---which require for validity that the premises and conclusion topically overlap. Note that neither of these two motivational ways need exclude the other. 
</div>

&ensp

<div style="text-align: justify">
In addition to the rather stable view that relevance require some form of topical overlap, relevant logics have been motivated using a notion of proof-theoretic utility: that the correctness of a deduction of a conclusion for a collection of premises require that the premises have been used in some substantial way. I will try to motivate the claim that this intuition can be accounted for using a topic-overlap-inspired property, namely that the consequence relation satisfy what Avron has called the *basic relevance criterion* (BRC). If the entailment consequence relation for a logic satisfies (BRC) then it follows that the logic satisfies the variable sharing property (VSP). There are, however, logics which satisfy (VSP) without satisfying (BRC) for entailment. Using Fine's semantics for relevant logics I'll sketch a proof that (BRC) holds not only for  the entailment for standard relevant logics between B and R, but also for the  standard/
"Official" consequence relation and that the property holds for Official consequence for  non-relevant logics such as RM<sub>3</sub>. (BRC), therefore, fails to yield relevance in the standard sense. 
</div>

\\

<div style="text-align: justify">
There are two topics that I wish to highlight during my talk: 
</div>

\\

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
First of all, whereas the variable sharing property has lately been strengthened in various ways---ways motivated by considerations of whether negation and relevant implication are themselves topically transparent contexts---the investigation into the BRC-property remains in its infancy. The other is to emphasize the importance of how logics with such strengthened variable sharing properties are motivated. Even though the relevant conditional is often called an "entailment conditional", I point to the fact that 
</div>

\\

- modus ponens fails for entailment for logics with stronger variable sharing properties---"depth relevance" and beneath 
- motivational cases from natural language are typically of contingently true conditionals, and 
- that theories formulated in relevant logics are typically investigated as being closed under "Official" consequence


in order to suggest that 


1. the motivational case for these logics is best view as of type A
2. that at least on of the intended consequence relations for these logics is the "Official" one
3. point to the fact that (2) is in tension with how much of current research practice


<div style="text-align: justify">
I'll end by suggesting that to combination of some form of hyperformality and the BRC-property might be a viable way to argue that there is an additional notion of logical consequence which require for validity not only truth-preservance but also topical overlap in virtue of logical form. 
</div>

\\
<a name="shawn"></a> **The Significance of Variable-Sharing**\\
Shawn Standefer *(National Taiwan University)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In previous work, I suggested that we can use variable-sharing to define the class of relevant logics. In this talk, I will expand on this idea and explore the significance of variable-sharing. The goal will be to identify some of its prominent philosophical consequences. I will also use it as a foil to help identify features of the usual suspects in the relevant logic literature, e.g. B, R, T, etc., that distinguish them as interesting and important logics.
</div>

\\
<a name="mina"></a> **Hybrid Relevant Logic**\\
Mina Young Pedersen *(University of Bergen)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This talk concerns a work-in-progress project on adding nominals and the operator @<sub>i</sub> from hybrid logic to the language of relevant logic. Hybrid logic is a modal logic that includes special propositional atoms, called nominals, where each nominal is true at only one state in the model. In effect, nominals let us name individual states and refer to them by formulas on the form @<sub>i</sub> Φ which we read as "Φ holds in the state called *i*". The project is motivated both by exploring modal logics in a relevant setting and by investigating the interesting mathematical structures that arise. The addition of nominals to relevant logic is not straightforward as a direct transfer of the valuation function from hybrid logic conflicts with the Heredity Lemma. We therefore propose that nominals name hereditarily closed sets instead of states in the model. In the talk, I show that the hybrid semantics of @<sub>i</sub> further conflicts with relevant motivations and discuss some non-standard alternatives.
</div>

\\
<a name="franci"></a> **Variable Sharing Beyond Logic: Two Case Studies**\\
Franci Magraviti *(University of Padua)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Is the notion of variable sharing central to relevant logic, or is it a mere byproduct? And how should it be expressed and understood? In this talk I want to explore a particular approach to addressing such questions, which is to look at the possible roles of the property under consideration (in this case, variable sharing) within practices outside of (the discipline of) logic itself. The idea is that, if a property P is core to a logic, then this should manifest in the way said logic partakes in other practices; conversely, looking at out-of-logic practices should provide insights (or at least support existing insights) into the best way to formulate P. Here I will focus on two (time permitting) case studies, inspired by the literature on relevant mathematics and feminist relevant logic:
</div>

1. if relevant logic is (in some sense) a good logic for mathematics, what is the mathematical value (as in: the value from the perspective of working mathematicians) of variable sharing?
2. if relevant logic is (in some sense) a good liberatory logic, what is the liberatory value of variable sharing?

<a name="yale"></a> **Shallow Syntactic Properties, Deep Semantic Correlates, and Variable Sharing**\\
Yale Weiss *(Philosophy Program and Saul Kripke Center, The Graduate Center, CUNY)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> In this talk I examine the Variable Sharing Property and variants and restrictions thereof from a semantic (i.e., model-theoretic) perspective. I am interested in identifying intuitively significant semantic properties in select model-theoretic frameworks which correspond to species of variable sharing. Some forms of variable sharing in some logics are robustly associated with natural semantic properties, while other forms appear (by "pessimistic induction") not to correspond to any semantically significant notion. Various technical results and their possible philosophical upshots are discussed.
</div>

\\
<a name="andrew"></a> **Representing Topics**\\
Andrew Tedder *(Ruhr University Bochum)*

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I (Tedder, forthcoming) have proposed a representation of topics as subalgebras, inspired by the recent work by Berto and his collaborators (2022). Berto's framework, however, is apparently much more general than mine -- he allows topics to come structured in terms of any old join semilattice, whereas the subalgebra lattice of any given algebra has significantly more structure. In this talk we investigate the question of when a Berto frame can be represented within a pair of an algebra and its subalgebra lattice. The answer turns on an algebraic property (JEP -- the joint embedding property) which corresponds, in extensions of FL, to a version of VSP which holds at the level of logical consequence (the pseudo-relevance property, as investigated by Maksimova). We consider the significance of this fact for the topical reading of VSP, and glimpse around at related territory. (Joint work with Wesley Fussner (CAS-ICS)).
